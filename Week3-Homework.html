<h2 id="in_javascript_functions_are_first_class_objects_what_does_it_mean_to_be_a_first_class_object">In Javascript, functions are first class objects. What does it mean to be a first class object?</h2>

<p>A function can be used anywhere an object can be used; in particular, you can pass functions as method arguments.  (We did this in last week&#8217;s homework by passing the <code>print</code> function into the <code>iterateAndOperate</code> method).  This is in contrast to a language like Java where functions are <em>not</em> first class objects, and the programmer must use interfaces and anonymous classes to get around this problem.  For instance, in Java, to delay the invocation of a function, you might do the following:</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="java"]
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("I was run!");
    }
})
[/sourcecode]
</div>

<p>whereas in Javascript, you could do something like</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
invokeLater(function() { print("I was run") });
[/sourcecode]
</div>

<p>assuming there was an <code>invokeLater</code> function.</p>

<p>This means that you must take care in not defining variables in the global namespace that have the same name as a function.  For instance,</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
// global variable
x = 5;

function x(args) {
    alert(args);   
}

// The global variable is shadowing the function name;
// the function is not called
x(5);
[/sourcecode]
</div>

Can you do some research and reflect on what he means by &#8216;secure construct&#8217;?</h2>

<p>A lambda basically means that you can pass a function as an argument to another function; this is due to the aforementioned first class nature of functions.  They are a secure construct because the scope of the functions is such that private variables in function A cannot be accessed by function B when A is passed into B.  In other words,</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
function outer(func) {
  // "undefined", since the &#8216;privateVariable&#8217;
  // field is scoped only to the inner function.
  return func.privateVariable;
}

function inner(a,b,c) {
  var privateVariable = 25;
  return a + ", " + b + ", " + c;
}

alert(outer(inner("cat","dog","bear")));
[/sourcecode]
</div>

<h2 id="can_you_explain_the_concept_of_a_closure">Can you explain the concept of a closure.</h2>

<p>A closure means that an inner function continues to have access to variables defined inside of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished.  I wrote an example <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/zt9jf/5/">you can view on jsfiddle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what_is_the_difference_between_a_function_and_a_method">What is the difference between a function and a method?</h2>

<p>A method is a function that is bound to an object, and thus it has an implicit &#8220;self&#8221; reference.</p>

<h2 id="in_javascript_there_is_no_implicit_type_checking_of_arguments_passed_to_functions_this_could_lead_to_bugs_if_programmers_are_not_careful_about_what_they_pass_to_functions_if_you_create_a_function_how_would_you_protect_it_from_well_meaning_but_careless_programmers">In Javascript there is no implicit type checking of arguments passed to functions. This could lead to bugs if programmers are not careful about what they pass to functions. If you create a function, how would you protect it from well meaning but careless programmers?</h2>

<p>You can do defensive checks within the function.  For instance, if a method is supposed to take in a number, you could do the following:</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
function numericalFunction(x) {
    if (typeof(x) != "number") {
        throw("Expected numerical value for numericalFunction; got " + x);
    }
    // Proceed as normal
}
[/sourcecode]
</div>

<p>You can also use the <code>arguments</code> implicit variable in the function to check that the number of arguments the user passed in is equal to the number of arguments that the method expects.  </p>

<h2 id="javascript_functions_have_implicit_access_to_something_called_this_this_points_to_different_things_depending_on_how_the_function_was_created_can_you_explain_why_we_need_this_and_what_it_represents_in_different_type_of_functions">Javascript functions have implicit access to something called <code>this</code>. <code>this</code> points to different things depending on how the function was created. Can you explain why we need <code>this</code>, and what it represents in different type of functions.</h2>

<p>If a function is created globally, its <code>this</code> pointer will be to the DOMObject.  If it&#8217;s created and bound to an object, the <code>this</code> pointer points to that object.  The following illustrates this:</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
function f() {
  return "f's this: " + this;
}

function nested() {
  function inner() {
    return "inner's this:" + this;
  }
  return inner();
}

// o is an object; add a method do it
var o = {};
o.f = f;
o.nested = nested;

o.newFunc = function() { return "newFunc's this: " + this; };
o.nestedFunc = function() { 
  var inner = function() {
    return "nestedFunc's inner this: " + this;
  }
  return inner();
}



print(f());
print(nested());
print(o.f());
print(o.nested());
print(o.newFunc());
print(o.nestedFunc());

// prints
// f's this: [object DOMWindow]
// inner's this:[object DOMWindow]
// f's this: [object Object]
// inner's this:[object DOMWindow]
// newFunc's this: [object Object]
// nestedFunc's inner this: [object DOMWindow]
//
[/sourcecode]
</div>

<p>Note that only the non nested functions that have been bound to object <code>o</code> point to that object as opposed to the DOMWindow.</p>

<p>The reason we want the <code>this</code> pointer is to be able to introspect on the type and contents of the object that is calling the function.  For instance, in my <a href="http://developmentality.wordpress.com/2011/02/05/javascript-101-week-2-functions-encapsulation-augmentation/">last assignment</a>, I used the <code>this</code> variable to produce a nice representation of an object:</p>

<div>
[sourcecode language="javascript"]
nick = {name:"Nick",age:23};

// This function returns a string representation of whatever
// is invoking it
function selfStringRep() {
  var str = "";
  for (var v in this) {
    // This is not an inherited property
    if (this.hasOwnProperty(v)) {
      str += "&#8217;" + v + "&#8217;: " + this[v] +"\n";
    }
  }
  return str;
}
Object.prototype.toString = selfStringRep;
print(nick.toString());
// prints
//&#8217;name&#8217;: Nick
//&#8217;age&#8217;: 23
