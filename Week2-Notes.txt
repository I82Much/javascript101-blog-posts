labeled break statements


for (name in object) {
	if (object.hasOwnProperty(name)) {
	
	}
}

switch can be a string or anything else.  case values can be expressions instead of constants

blocks do not have scope! only function scope

no void type in javascript; if you say 'return' this is same as 'return undefined'

can augment any object (add new fields.)

object(o) function

prototypal inheritance rather than classical inheritance


objects are passed by reference, not value

arrays length - always 1 larger than highest integer subscript


to determine if obj is array

value.constructor === Array
value instanceof Array


# Eloquent Javascript

> The defining properties of pure functions are that they always return the same value when given the same arguments, and never have side effects. They take some arguments, return a value based on these arguments, and do not monkey around with anything else.
