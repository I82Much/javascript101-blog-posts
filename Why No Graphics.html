<H1>Why This Site Has Almost No Graphics</H1>

The real reason is explained in an interview with <cite>The Guardian</cite>: "<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/aug/09/guardianweeklytechnologysection.interviews">The web design guru that web designers love to hate</a>." My scaled-back design has a strong effect on the reflective level of Don Norman's theory for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465051367?tag=useitcomusablein" title="Dr. Norman's book, 'Emotional Design: Why We Love (or Hate) Everyday Things' - info at Amazon.com" class="ouot">emotional design</a>.

<p>
My original reasons, when I designed the site in 1995, were as follows:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="/alertbox/9703a.html" TITLE="Alertbox March 1997: The Need for Speed">Download times rule the Web</A>, and since many users still don't have broadband, Web pages can be no more than 6 KB if they are to download in one second which is the required response time for hypertext navigation. Users do not keep their attention on the page if downloading exceeds 10 seconds, corresponding to 60 KB at modem speed. Keeping below these size limits rules out most graphics.
<LI>I am not a visual designer, so my graphics would look crummy anyway. Since this website is created by myself (and not by a multidisciplinary team as I always recommend for large sites) I didn't want to spend money to hire an artist.
</UL>

These arguments are still relevant, even though most users now have broadband access and can accommodate a few images. Indeed, I have started using screenshot and charts in my articles from time to time.
<p>

For more info about the need for sub-second response times, see my book
<A HREF="/jakob/mmhtbook.html">Multimedia and Hypertext: The Internet and Beyond</A>
or my short essay on the <A HREF="/papers/responsetime.html">three main response time limits</A>.
<P>
I did have to add a small glyph to the navigation bar to emphasize the meaning of the hierarchy nesting. My original design used a simple colon to separate the levels, but some users thought that the colons indicated alternative choices on the same level (and not a progressively deeper nesting of options, as intended). The arrows seem to be slightly easier to understand as an indication of moving deeper and deeper into the site.

<p>
(Update 2007: note that the current recommendation for the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/breadcrumbs.html" title="Alertbox: Breadcrumb Navigation Increasingly Useful" class="new">breadcrumb separator</a> is to simply use a &gt; [greater-than sign]. Users are now so accustomed to breadcrumbs that there's no need for the added symbolism provided by an arrow.)

<h2>Web Hosting</h2>

Useit.com and nngroup.com are both <a href="http://promote.pair.com/direct.pl?nngroup.com+11705">hosted on Pair Networks</a>. (With domain name registration at <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2384032-10378406" title="Domain name registration at GoDaddy.com" class="out">GoDaddy.com</a>.)

<p>
I have used Pair since 1996 for various smaller projects and been very satisfied, and since 2005 I am hosting the two high-traffic sites there as well. Good performance and almost no downtime.

<p>
One benefit of the small number of graphics on this site is that I can serve a quarter million unique users per month and about 50 GB/month data transfer with a relatively cheap Web hosting account that covers both sites for $75/month. The cost of running the sites comes to 0.02 cents per user or 0.005 cents per pageview served.

<p>
Even though I'm happy with Pair Networks, and even though they offer their own domain hosting service, I still stick with <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-2384032-10378406" title="Domain name registration at GoDaddy.com" class="out">GoDaddy</a> for domain hosting. This is to reserve the possibility of switching my hosting to another service at a moment's notice if Pair ever degrades its service the way every other hosting company I've ever been with has eventually done. (To the credit of Pair's founders, they have not sold out to a big company with bad service, but one never knows whether that could happen.) It's safest to separate site hosting and domain names, and maintain the two at different companies.
